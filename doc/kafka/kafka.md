# Kafka

## Producer


### Prepare Sending

- We create a `ProducerRecord` including a topic, an optional key and a value.
- We initialize a `KafkaProducer`. 
  - 3 properties are mandatory:
    - `bootstrap.servers`: list of `host:port`brokers (not necessary to list them all).
    - `key.serializer`: how to serialize keys into byte arrays (necessary even if there is no key, `VoidSerializer`).
    - `value.serializer`: how to serialize values into byte arrays.
  - Optional properties: 
    - `client.id` a logical identifier for the client used for logging, metrics and quotas
- We provide the record to the `KafkaProducer#send()` method (supports multi-threading access).
- The `KafkaProducer`:
  - checks that the buffer is not full, otherwise it waits
  - invokes the interceptor `ProducerInterceptor#onSend(ProducerRecord)` that can update the entire record
  - retrieves information about partitions related to the specified topic
  - serializes the key using the `key.serializer` into byte arrays
  - serializes the value using the `value.serializer` into byte arrays
  - if we didn't specify a partition, invokes the `Partitionner` that returns the partition number, otherwise it uses the specified partition
  - if _compression.type_ is defined (snappy, gzip, lz4, zstd), the message is compressed
  - checks the size of the message, if it's too large a _RecordTooLargeException_ is thrown
  - checks whether the size of buffered messages doesn't reach _buffer.memory_ bytes otherwise it starts to wait
  - adds the record to a batch of records that will be sent to the same partition
  - uses a separate thread to send batches to the right broker
  - returns a `Future` object if it's performed before _max.block.ms_ otherwise a _TimeoutException_ is thrown

The `acks` parameter specified by producers, controls how many partition replicas must receive the record and answer to the producer to consider the write successful.
This parameter influences the _producer latency_, not the _end-to-end latency_.
- `acks=0`: the producer wonâ€™t even wait for a response from the broker. It immediately considers the write successful the moment the record is sent out. This achieves very high throughput.
- `acks=1`: the producer will consider the write successful when the leader receives the record (default).
- `acks=all=-1`: the producer will consider the write successful when all of the in-sync replicas receive the record. This is achieved by the leader broker that will send back a response once all the in-sync replicas receive the record themselves. This increases latency. This is used in combination with `min.insync.replicas` that specifies the minimum number of in-sync brokers (including the leader). If the number of in-sync broker is no reached, an error is triggered.


### Sending

Once the `Future`is returned to the caller. There are 3 ways of interacting with it:
  - _Fire-and-forget send_: we don't care if the message arrived successfully, we don't on anything with this `Future`.
  - _Synchronous send_: we invoke `Future#get()` that will wait until we know if the message arrived or not.
  - _Asynchronous send_: we provide a callback function (reactive way) to the `Future`.

The batch is sent: 
- if the amount of memory in bytes of messages in the current batch is >= _batch.size_ or,
- if the waited time >= _linger.ms_.

Delivery timeout:
- This is the maximum time spent from the point a record is ready for sending (placed in a batch, i.e., _send()_ returned). 
- Definition: _delivery.timeout.ms_ >= _linger.ms_ + _retry.backoff.ms_ + _request.timeout.ms_. 
- If the timeout is reached, the original exception (in case of a retry), otherwise the timeout exception is provided in the callback. 
- Take into account the time needed for a leader election.
- _request.timeout.ms_:
  - the timeout for a broker answer when sending data (doesn't include retries)
  - if the timeout is reached, it will either retry or complete with a timeout exception
- _retries_ and _retry.backoff.ms:
  - _retries_ indicates how many times the producer will retry sending (O means "no retry")
  - _retry.backoff.ms_ specifies the time between retries
  - not all errors are re-triable, some are not transient (like "message too large")
- _linger.ms_: 
  - the amount of time to wait for additional messages before sending the current batch (default is 0)
  - this increases (a little) a single message latency, but increases throughput



TODO
- The broker sends back a response `RecordMetadata` (containing the topic, partition and offset), or an error.

## Consumers

TODO 

Kafka will not allow consumers to read records until they are written to all in sync replicas.

- `End-to-end latency`: measured from the time a record was produced until it's available for consumers
